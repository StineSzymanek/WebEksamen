        <h1>Universal design</h1>
        <p>
            Below is our text about universal design for one of our obligatory assignments in the course Technology and
            Society.
            There were two tasks, one about universal design for elderly people and one about how innovation is going to
            keep up with universal design. Here you can <a href="https://universaldesign.ie/what-is-universal-design/">
                learn more about universal design

        <h2>For the elderly</h2>
        <p>
            A part of the population that universal design is helpful for, is the elderly. It helps with safety,
            independence, and helps with living to the full extent by not limiting what they can do. Here we will list
            ten ways that universal design can help the elderly live a longer and happier life. We got some
            <a href="https://aginginplace.com/universal-design/" target="_blank">information about universal design and
                the elderly</a>
            from aginginplace.com.

            <ol>
                <li>Universal design can help older people live longer and safer by preventing falls and injuries. An
                    example
                    of this is grab bars in bathrooms and showers that a person can hold onto.</li>
                <li>
                    Grab bars in the bathroom and a seat in the shower helps people in wheelchairs and gives the elderly
                    a
                    more comfortable experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Slip resistant surfaces make it less likely that elderly people will fall and hurt themselves. This
                    is
                    especially useful in the bathroom where wet tiles are easy to slip on.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Having a one-story house makes it easier for elderly people to have access to everything in their
                    home as
                    they might have trouble walking up stairs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Having no steps at the entrance of the house can help the elderly get easy access to the house,
                    especially for those who use a wheelchair or a walker.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Wide hallways and doors makes it easier to move around independently for elderly people who are
                    using a
                    wheelchair or a walker.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Having universally designed transportation methods lets older people get out of the house on their
                    own.
                    These could be ramps for wheelchair access and designated seats right by the entrance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Entertainment with subtitles, such as TV shows, is useful for older people who have experienced
                    hearing
                    loss, which is common as one ages.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Smart phones and tablets that don’t require complex movements such as using several fingers at a
                    time can
                    help with technology access for the elderly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Multi-level counters give access for more people to work comfortably, including those in a
                    wheelchair.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <h2>Innovation keeping up with universal design</h2>
        <p>
            We think that laws and regulations can help technology developers keep up with universal design. These laws
            should be concrete and easy to follow so that every company can manage to follow them when creating products
            and services. The regulations would have to state that the product must be usable to all groups of people,
            including people with disabilities. The regulations should be international, it doesn’t help much if it’s
            only in Norway. It would be hard to achieve but having common regulations for the whole world would help the
            most people. A lot of products that come to Norway, America etc. are from other parts of the world, and if
            those countries don’t have guidelines for universal design, then that will affect us too.
            The challenge with this is that developing products with universal design can be costly, and not everyone
            can afford this. Forcing people with laws might not always work, so a different strategy could be to also
            implement inclusivity and universal design in education. If the education people receive in different fields
            includes lessons about inclusivity and universal design, people will become aware of the challenges that
            other people face. This will hopefully make them consider universal design when creating products and
            services in the future and give them some tips on how to do it. It’s not enough to have laws in place if
            people have no idea how to create something with universal design. Companies need to be knowledgable on the
            <a href="https://universaldesign.ie/what-is-universal-design/the-7-principles/the-7-principles.html">
                7 principles of universal design</a> and keep them in mind from the beginning of creating a new product.
