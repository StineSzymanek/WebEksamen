        <h1>Accessibility</h1>
        <p>This page is about accessibility and how we tested for it using an automated test, and the choices we made
            for
            universal design beyond the automated test.
        </p>
        <h2>Choices for universal design</h2>
        <p>
            We tried to keep accessibility and universal design in mind while we were creating the site.
            We tried to make sure our HTML elements were structured properly so that tools like screen readers would
            work
            properly on our site. Elements that can be clicked also need to be keyboard focusable.
            The only elements on our site that you can click are the links in the navigation bar.
            Those are already keyboard focusable, but we checked it using “inspect element” on our website and hovering
            over the elements. There you can see some accessibility information, and it showed that the links were
            keyboard
            focusable. When choosing the colors of our page, we had to keep the contrast between text and background
            high
            enough so that people with vision impairment can still see the text clearly. There is information about the
            contrast when you hover over elements when inspecting the page, and the contrast was high enough.
            When it comes to line height, W3 recommends spacing between 1.5 and 2, so that's why we chose 1.8 line height for
            the paragraphs. Using a unitless value makes sure that if the user zooms to increase the text size, the line height
            will scale proportionately.
        </p>
        <h2>The automated test</h2>
        <p>
            The automated test “AChecker” told us there were no problems with our site, so we tried another
            accessibility tool
            called “WAVE”. We learned that “Image of…” should be avoided in alternative text for images because screen
            readers and
            browser presentation already inform the users that the element is an image. Other than that, the
            accessibility checker
            didn’t show us any problems.
