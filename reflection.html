        <h1>Learning to code</h1>
        <p>This page is about the challenges our group experienced when we transitioned to university and started
            learning
            how to code.

            <p>When I finished high school and was about to start university, programming was one of the subjects I most
                looked forward to. I had a little bit experience with programming from high school, and therefore knew
                some
                stuff about what it was all about.
                Still, there was a lot to learn.
            </p>

            When it comes to programming, I feel both a feeling of mastery and a
            lot of
            frustration. Either the code works or nothing happens. This means that you can, for example, sit for a
            long
            time only to finally find a small error in the program.
            When you in the end find the error, you are both relieved and happy. Then I can learn from the mistake,
            but
            also get motivation to solve new tasks.
            Another thing about programming is that I constantly find out how much I dont know, as soon as I learn
            something new, new questions and problems arise. This means that you have to practice a lot to become
            good,
            and to get enough knowledge as you need.

        <h2>Group member 2s experience</h2>
        <div class="box">
            <p>I've always been fascinated by programming from a young age, but it wasn't before the age of 27 that I
                set
                out to dive into it. We started programming in html, css and java. I would compare it to learning a
                language, but where factors other than vocabulary are just as important.

            We have had to learn to think
            at a
            very "low" level, where we have to make sure that a computer understands what we want it to do.
            This has
            been very instructive and certainly something that has changed how we generally think in our everyday
            lives.
            We have so far been through the most basic, and are now learning to combine the different parts. We have
            already done some projects, and I feel that has been most instructive.

                I came straight from upper-secondary school to university, and I had never coded anything before at all.
                The beginning was kind of confusing and difficult, even from the first Hello World program. I didn't
                understand
                what anything did, just put the text "Hello World" in and hoped I would understand it soon.
            </p>

        </div>
        <p>
            I didn't understand package, class, static, void or even println. After the first few
            lectures, a lot of my confusion was already cleared, and I accepted that sometimes I would just have to be
            confused
            while learning. I still didn't know what a class really was, but I understood that there were other things I
            needed
            to know and just had to let the classes be. It was a different type of learning from upper-secondary school
            because
            all the responsibility was
            on myself to learn, and even more different because of the lectures being recordings and over Zoom instead
            of in person.
            It was actually nice to have the responsibility on me and to be able to structure my day how I wanted,
            because it
            allowed me to work on what I personally needed.

                A little later we started with HTML and once again I was confused, but I knew that it would get easier
                after a few weeks so I didn't stress about it, and the same thing when we started with CSS. The first
                obligatory
                assignment I spent way too much time figuring very simple things out, but it turned out to be OK. There
                are
                obviously still
                so many things I haven't learned, but I am excited for it.
